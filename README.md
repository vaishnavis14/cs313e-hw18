This project implements a message encryption and decryption system using a binary search tree (BST) to manage characters based on a provided string. The program processes input to construct the BST, allowing users to encrypt messages by generating sequences of left and right traversals, and subsequently decrypt them back to their original form. The implementation ensures that only lowercase letters and spaces are considered, effectively handling non-alphabetic characters during the encryption process.
